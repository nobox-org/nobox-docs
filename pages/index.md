# Understanding Nobox

Nobox is a backend as a service (BaaS) solution that provides backend-related services for client-facing applications. It provides essential functionalities such as Authentication/Authorization and Create/Read/Update/Delete/Search Operations, eliminating the need for developers to set up their own backend infrastructure.

For instance, imagine a React developer building an ecommerce platform. With Nobox, they can seamlessly manage products and customers without the hassle of creating a backend from scratch. By utilizing our user-friendly Nobox Npm Client, developers can effortlessly add, delete, and search for products, manage a buyer dashboard, apply tags to products, and even generate personalized recommendations. Nobox also supports advanced features like population, allowing you to fetch related data from multiple record spaces in a single query, similar to SQL JOINs but with the flexibility of NoSQL.

## Where Can I Use Nobox?

Currently, Nobox can be used in any JavaScript codebase or platform through our NPM library. We are actively working on expanding our support by developing additional SDKs and client libraries for non-JavaScript platforms. We welcome your suggestions and ideas, and would definitely love to hear from you. Please feel free to reach out to us at `nobox.hq@gmail.com`.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”— Population Support
Nobox supports population, allowing you to fetch related data from multiple record spaces in a single query. This is similar to SQL JOINs but with the flexibility of NoSQL.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Fetch posts with author and category information
const postsWithDetails = await PostModel.find(
  {},
  {
    populate: [
      {
        fields: {
          from: "user",
          localKey: "authorId",
          foreignKey: "id",
          newField: "author"
        },
        space: "user"
      }
    ]
  }
);
```
