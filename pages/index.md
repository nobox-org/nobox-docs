# {% $markdoc.frontmatter.title %}

Nobox is a backend as a service product that allows client-facing applications make use of backend-related services like Authentication/Authorization and Create/Read/Update/Delete/Search Operations. 

For instance, with Nobox, a react developer build an ecommerce platform would not need to setup a backend infrastructure to manage products and customers. With our Nobox Npm Client, she or he would be able to add products, delete products , search products, manage a dashboard of buyers, tag product and even make recommendations.

## Where can I use Nobox
As of now, nobox can be used via our NPM library in any javascript codebase or platform.

In coming days, we would release more SDK / client library that makes it possible to use nobox in non-javascript platforms. Feel free to reach us at `nobox.hq@gmail.com` for suggestions and ideas on which Clients and SDKs we should build
