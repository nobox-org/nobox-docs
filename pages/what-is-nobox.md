# What is Nobox?

Nobox is a powerful backend as a service (BaaS) product that simplifies the development process for client-facing applications. With Nobox, developers can leverage backend-related services such as authentication, authorization, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on records without the need to set up and maintain a complex backend infrastructure.

## Getting Started

To start using Nobox, you can install the Nobox npm client library available on GitHub: [Nobox Npm Client](https://github.com/nobox-org/nobox-js-client). The npm client provides all the necessary functionalities and APIs to integrate Nobox into your JavaScript codebase.

## Future Development

We are continuously working to expand the capabilities of Nobox and make it available on various platforms. In the future, we plan to release additional SDKs and client libraries to enable the use of Nobox in non-JavaScript platforms. We welcome your suggestions and ideas for new clients and SDKs. Feel free to reach out to us at `nobox.hq@gmail.com` with your feedback.
